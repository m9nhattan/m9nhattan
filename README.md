# 👋 Hi, I’m Jacques

👀 I'm the solo founder of [Faraday HQ](faradayhq.com). Faraday operates in the digital privacy space. 
Our core product is [exo](https://exo.faradayhq.com), wherein I work with high-risk individuals to help 
them get on top of their digital presence and mitigate risks surrounding personal information exposure.

🕵️ I Have a particular interest in software & product development, design, infosec, cryptography, and digital privacy.

⚖️ ⚛️ I’m also in my 5th year of studying Law and Science degrees at the University of Auckland. 
 I'm focussing my legal studies on Commercial, Privacy, and Technology Law - and my Science studies focus on Statistics and Physiology.
 
In terms of what is on my GitHub, a lot of my repos are private, but I'll be sharing a few things here and there.
